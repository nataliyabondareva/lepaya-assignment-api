## Hey! So what's this? :dizzy:

This is a ZEIT Now serverless backend. It gives you a requested number of unique numbers. 

## And why this? 

It's serverless! No need for clunky backends. It's also quick to use, smooth to deploy, and easy to use.

## Can you show me an example?

Sure! Go to [here](https://lepaya-assignment-api.tallybee.now.sh/api/?max=100&numberRequired=10) for an array of 10 numbers between 1 and 10.

## How do I install this? 

Super simple. Once initialized, you can deploy with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```

This should work! Have fun
